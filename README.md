<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Junct][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

While I was brainstorming what I should do as my final project with Eleven Fifty Academy, my wife (Who is an Event Coordinator) threw me a pitch for an Event Scheduling platform. I was hooked. I decided to try my hand at making a small scheduling app utilizing C#, .NET Core, and Blazor. During this project, I learned a great many things. The first one was how to utilize the new Blazor frameworks. Surprisingly easy to master if you know any C#, and the dynamic loading is glorious. I did have quite the time trying to get it to deploy correctly to Azure. Which brings me to the second biggest lesson of this project. Azure IS HUGE, and I only scratched the surface with this project. 

--At the time of deploying this initially, I am still working out the kinks. I plan on continuing to develop this app after my time at Eleven Fifty Academy.

### Built With

* [Blazor](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/aspnet/web-apps/blazor)
* [VSCommunity 2019](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/)
* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com)
* [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/) How??-- Their app troubleshooting was instrumental with trying to track down server connection bugs.




<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

Currently this app is just ran locally. While I attempted to get the app on Azure, I am still working on the identification issues I was experiencing.
Clone the repo, set the server side of the project as the start up project, and run. Create a dummy account by clicking on the Sign up and Login buttons (top right).
